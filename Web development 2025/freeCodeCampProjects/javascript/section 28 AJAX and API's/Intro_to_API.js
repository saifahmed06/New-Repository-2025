API: Application programming interface

API is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be matchMedia, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conversations to follow Etc  
It can also provide extension mechanism so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.
An API can be entirely to a Component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, which allows users to use the interface independently of the implementation
